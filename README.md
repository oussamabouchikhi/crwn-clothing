<summary>4. Heroku Setup</summary>

## Things to set before you deploy

You will also need to connect your existing Heroku app to this new forked and cloned repo, or you have to create a new Heroku app and push to it. A quick refresher on how to do either of these:

<details>
<summary>Set to an existing Heroku app</summary>

To set to an existing Heroku app you already have deployed, you need to know the name of the app you want to deploy to. To see a list of all the apps you currently have on Heroku:

```
heroku apps
```

Copy the name of the app you want to connect the project to, then run:

```
heroku git:remote -a <PASTE_YOUR_APP_NAME_HERE>
```

And now you'll have your repo connected to the heroku app under the git remote name `heroku`.

Then skip to the bottom of this article to see what to do next!
</details>

<details>
<summary>Create a new Heroku app</summary>
<br>
Create a new Heroku project by typing in your terminal:

```
heroku create
```

This will create a new Heroku project for you. Then run:

```
git remote -v
```

You should see heroku `https://git.heroku.com/<RANDOMLY_GENERATED_NAME_OF_YOUR_APP>` in the list. This means you have successfully connected your project to the newly created Heroku app under the git remote of `heroku`.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Deploying to Heroku</summary>

Add the `mars/create-react-app-buildpack` to your heroku project by typing:

```
heroku buildpacks:set mars/create-react-app-buildpack
```

You can then deploy to heroku by running:

```
git push heroku master
```

You will see this warning message if you are pushing to an existing app:

```
! [rejected]        master -> master (fetch first)
error: failed to push some refs to 'https://git.heroku.com/hasura-crwn-clothing.git'
hint: Updates were rejected because the remote contains work that you do
hint: not have locally. This is usually caused by another repository pushing
hint: to the same ref. You may want to first integrate the remote changes
hint: (e.g., 'git pull ...') before pushing again.
hint: See the 'Note about fast-forwards' in 'git push --help' for details.
```

This is because we are pushing to an existing app that was deploying an entirely different repository from what we have now. Simply run:

```
git push heroku master --force
```

This will overwrite the existing Heroku app with our new code.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Open our Heroku project</summary>

After heroku finishes building our project, we can simply run:

```
heroku open
```

This will open up our browser and take us to our newly deployed Heroku project!
